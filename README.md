Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphic representation of data. 
To communicate information clearly and efficiently, data visualization uses statistical graphics, plots, information graphics and other tools. 
Numerical data may be encoded using dots, lines, or bars, to visually communicate a quantitative message. 
Also data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
